<h1> Week 1 Post </h1>
<h2>What are your expectations for this class</h2>
I expect to learn a lot about both in terms of technical skills and soft skills. In terms of technical skills, I hope to learn a lot about front-end stacks such as React, Node.js, and just Javascript in general.
In terms of soft skills, I expect to learn even more about working on a team using Agile and TDD.

I mainly prepped for classes by buying/selling textbooks, mapping out the syllabi from my classes onto my calendar, and networking with freshmen.

I have to do a LOT before the career fair, which includes the following: 1) Finish project for CS373, 2) Finish project for CS361, 3) Do biweekly readings for my management class, 4) Revamp my personal project to include more unit
tests as well as mocking, 5) Crash course python
