<h1> Week 2 Post </h1>
<h2>What did you do this past week? </h2>
I spent the week completing assignments + preparing for career fair. 
<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I still have to do a LOT before the career fair, which includes the following: 1) Finish project for CS373, 2) Finish project for CS361 (clarify stuff w/ prof), 3) Do biweekly readings for my management class, 4) Revamp my personal project to include more unit
tests as well as mocking, 5) Crash course python (in order to have a working knowledge of python to complete the first project). I've tried to crash course python in the past, but this time, I've decided to learn python by doing a LOT of basic exercises on websites such as Hackerrank.
Overall, I think I'm making some pretty decent progress.
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Once my personal project is complete, I'll mainly be working on project 1 for this class, and my project for CS361 in my spare time
<h2>Experience in the class:</h2>
Still seems pretty interesting, though there's only been a few lectures. Prof. Downing has a really unique way of explaining concepts to us.
