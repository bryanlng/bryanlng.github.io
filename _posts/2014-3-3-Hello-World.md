1. What did you do this past week?
  This past week, I mainly prepared for the beginning of the school year. This included buying my required textbooks for the various courses I was taking, updating my resume, and designing a schedule/routine in which I would act upon for the rest of the year.
2. What's in your way?
  Lack of time. With the beginning of the school year at hand, too much of my time is spent doing errands.
3. What will you do next week?
  I will begin the first "legitimate" week of school, in which I will begin to continually test and re-develop my routine. 

Experience in the class (so far):
  So far class has been interesting. Even though we've only had 2 classes, within the first 5 minutes of class starting, I could tell that this class was going to be a one-of-a-kind learning experience.For example, on the first day, while most classes would spend the entire period going over the syllabus, we began discussing new material within the first 10 minutes. On the second day of class, we had a quiz, which I did fairly eh on.
  
  From the first day, Professor Downing encouraged a friendly but competitive atmosphere, with emphasis on us becoming more social beings. This was enforced by him requiring us to introduce ourselves to the person next to us. In addition, he called on random members of the class during the lecture to explain parts of the code we were just learning, which probably put many of us at the edge of our seats due to anxiety. But as nervous as it made all of us, we knew it was something we had to overcome, as we would have to do the very same thing to our future co-workers and bosses.
   
  
  Pick of the week:

  Basically it changes the color (K value/wavelength) of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day. In doing so, it significantly helps to reduce the effects of dry eye syndrome. As a user of this product for over a year, it has really helped me get through late night projects.
