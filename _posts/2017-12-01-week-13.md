<h1> Week 13 Post </h1>
<h2>Pros:</h2>
  - I was able to learn many different tools and languages, such as Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Google Cloud Platform, Postman, etc.
  - I was able to improve on my fundamentals (better OOP practices)
  - Professor Downing is a fantastic lecturer, who introduces and teaches concepts in a logical and concise manner.
  
<h2>Cons:</h2>
  - To those who haven't taken this class:
  - To the TAs/ Professor downing:
    * Perhaps using another deployment platform, such as AWS or Heroku, would be optimal. Although I 1)deeply respect the computing capabilities
    of GCP, and 2) Enjoy the fact that I was able to learn how to deploy something online, deployment was an incredible pain in the ass that I 
    prefer not to experience again.
    * In the future, there should be a certain grade percentage attributed to a team report/ peer evaluation. This evaluation would be used to 
    reward hard-working team members for their effort and persistence, and penalize team members who didn't do their part. By having this system,
    it would encourage all members of the team to work hard and put in their fair share. Should there be a dispute, members would be able to talk 
    with the TA/ the professor.
